What authorized sources of information did you use to complete
the assignment? COPY THE LIST of authorized sources of information
given in the "Policies" web page to this section of the readme file,
and edit it as appropriate.

The course's lectures.

The course's precepts.

The course's website.

Documents that are referenced directly by the course's website. Such 
documents include the course's lecture slides and precept handouts.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What unauthorized sources of information did you use to complete the
assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information that you used
to complete the assignment, and describe how you used them. The course
"Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of information, and
any source that you have used but not listed in the authorized sources
should be included here. Please note that using an unauthorized source
may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the nature of the
interaction, may additionally require the interaction being reported
to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used no
unauthorized sources of information.
None

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?
The assignment was tedious but helpufl. It was not fun.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
In my implementation of symtablehash, for the sake of modularity, I
reused all my code from symtablelist and renamed them to be LinkedList
functions. Although it ran more checks and required likely more
time to run some functins, through some test I found that this did not
slow down the implementation by much. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write
"None."
None


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on symtablelist.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablelist.c: line 53: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvValue' through an assert?

   symtablelist.c: line 178: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

   Since the values of pvValue and pvExtra can be NULL, we do not
   want to assert the values of pvValue and pvExtra.

What warnings does splint generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and express your
disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then write

None

What warnings does critTer generate on symtablehash.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

   symtablehash.c: line 408: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pfApply' through an assert?

   symtablehash.c: line 408: medium priority:
   Do you want to validate 'pvExtra' through an assert?

   Since the values of pvValue and pvExtra can be NULL, we do not
   want to assert the values of pvValue and pvExtra.

   symtablehash.c: line 73: medium priority:
   Function names should be prefixed with module names;
   function name LinkedList_new does not match module name symtablehash.c

   For clarity, I wanted to name the functions to start with LinkedList
   to imply that they are a seperate function. Another solution would've
   been to put them in a seperate file, but the assignment wanted 1 file.

   symtablehash.c: line 419: low priority: 
   A file should contain no more than 15 functions;
   this file contains 19 functions
   The file contains 9 edited functions from symtablelist and 10 functions
   from symtablehash.

What are the CPU times reported by testsymtable.c with binding counts
50, 500, 5000, 50000, and 500000 using (1) your linked list
implementation, (2) your non-expanding hash table implementation, and
(3) your expanding hash table implementation? Fill in the blanks.

The linked list implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.00000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.010000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 1.000000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 99.320000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed over 5 minutes.

The non-expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.00000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.010000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.400000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 68.340000 seconds.

The expanding hash table implementation with:
-- 50 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 500 bindings consumed 0.000000 seconds.
-- 5000 bindings consumed 0.020000 seconds.
-- 50000 bindings consumed 0.250000 seconds.
-- 500000 bindings consumed 2.250000 seconds.
